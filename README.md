# NPC Density Adjuster for FiveM

This FiveM script dynamically adjusts NPC and vehicle densities based on the number of players on the server. The script is designed to improve performance by increasing NPC and vehicle density when there are fewer players on the server, and decreasing them as more players join.

This helps maintain a balanced and smooth performance during times of low server activity, while still having a realistic NPC and vehicle presence during peak times.

## Features

- **Dynamic NPC and Vehicle Density:** The script automatically adjusts NPC and vehicle densities based on the current player count. Fewer players = more NPCs, more players = fewer NPCs.
- **Player Count Validation:** Ensures that only valid player counts are used to adjust densities.
- **Debugging Support:** Provides detailed logs to help with troubleshooting and debugging.
- **Customizable Thresholds:** Configure thresholds for player count to define how densities should scale.
